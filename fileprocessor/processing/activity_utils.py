# Placeholder Function for Extracting Activity Code
# 
# This function is a preliminary implementation and requires further development.
# Since the company's activity descriptions do not directly match those in the database,
# NLP techniques need to be applied to find the best approximate match.
#
# Future enhancements may include:
# - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
# - Similarity measurement using NLP models (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, or BERT)
# - Implementation of fuzzy matching techniques (e.g., Levenshtein distance)
#
# This function currently serves as a dummy placeholder for future refinement.



def extract_activity_code(activity):

    extended in the future to apply transformations or validations if needed.

    Parameters:
    activity (str): The activity code or description.
